Implementation of a rotation system and certain rules made by [winterNebs](https://github.com/winterNebs) for his falling block puzzle game [Ascension](https://asc.winternebs.com)
This won't be 100% faithful to the Ascension game, this will be a hybrid of guideline and ASC, picking and choosing what features I want from each.
